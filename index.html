                Doge is an Internet meme that became popular in 2013. The meme typically consists
              of a picture of a Shiba Inu accompanied by multicolored text in Comic Sans
              font in the foreground. The text, representing a kind of internal monologue,
              is deliberately written in a form of broken English. </span>
              <span class="show-more" onclick="revealMoreDoge()">Show more...</span><br>

              <span class="second-part">The meme is based on a 2010 photograph, and became popular in late 2013,
              being named as Know Your Meme's "top meme" of that year. A cryptocurrency
              based on Doge, the Dogecoin, was launched in December 2013, and the Shiba Inu
              has been featured on Josh Wise's NASCAR car as part of a sponsorship deal. Doge
              has also been referenced by members of the United States Congress, a safety video
              for Delta Air Lines, a Google Easter egg, and the video for the song "Word
              Crimes" by "Weird Al" Yankovic.</span>

            <!-- <div class="doggest-disc">
              <span class="first-part">Doggest is a slang term for “dog” that is primarily
                associated with pictures of Shiba Inus (nicknamed “Shibe”) and internal
                monologue captions on Tumblr. These photos may be photoshopped to change
                the dog’s face or captioned with interior monologues in Comic Sans font.

                <span class="second-part">The use of the misspelled word “doge” to refer
                  to a dog dates back to June 24th, 2005, when it was mentioned in an episode
                  of Homestar Runner’s puppet show. In the episode titled “Biz Cas Fri 1”,
                  Homestar calls Strong Bad his “d-o-g-e” while trying to distract him from his work.</span>
